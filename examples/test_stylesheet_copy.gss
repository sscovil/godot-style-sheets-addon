Button:
	# You can define colors using Godot's Color class.
	bg_color: Color(0, 0, 0, 0.4)
	
	# The corner_radius property applies the same radius to top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right.

	# Likewise, you can define top, bottom, left, and right separately, or apply the same margin value to all sides.
	expand_margin: 20px
	
	# You can define fonts using the `res://` prefix to reference a font file in your project.

		# You can define colors using hex codes, with or without alpha values.

		expand_margin_top: 0
		expand_margin_bottom: 0
